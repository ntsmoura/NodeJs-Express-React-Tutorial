# How to run

If you are on a linux system and you have all needed dependencies:

Open 1 terminal, go to **backend** folder and run: 
```
npx nodemon index
``` 
Open another terminal, go to **frontend** folder and run:
```
npm start
```

**obs**: Make sure to have a MySQL database running on localhost:5000
